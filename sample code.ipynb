    "## How It All Works Together\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully understand how this code works, let's trace through the execution flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The program starts by loading the configuration from `config.yaml`\n",
    "2. It defines parameter ranges for different ward configurations\n",
    "3. For each configuration scenario:\n",
    "   - It runs multiple replications of the simulation\n",
    "   - For each replication:\n",
    "     - It creates a SimPy environment and ward\n",
    "     - It starts generating patients according to the arrival distribution\n",
    "     - For each patient:\n",
    "       - It tries to assign them to a bed following the algorithm\n",
    "       - If no bed is available, they join a queue and retry periodically\n",
    "       - Once assigned a bed, they stay for their length of stay and then leave\n",
    "     - Throughout the simulation, it collects data on waiting times, queue lengths, and occupancy\n",
    "   - It aggregates results across replications\n",
    "4. It compiles results across scenarios and generates visualizations and reports\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation is a complex system, but by breaking it down into distinct components with clear responsibilities, it becomes more manageable to understand, implement, and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Need to Implement for Your Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete your assignment based on the Penn et al. paper, you would need to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The core data structures (Patient, Bed, Bay, Ward)\n",
    "2. The bed assignment algorithm (the most complex part)\n",
    "3. The simulation processes (patient generator, patient journey)\n",
    "4. The experimentation framework for testing different ward configurations\n",
    "5. Data collection and analysis for producing results similar to Table 2 in the paper\n",
    "\n",
    "The code I've outlined provides a comprehensive framework for implementing this simulation, but you would need to adapt it to the specific requirements of your assignment, such as using empirical distributions from the Penn et al. study."
